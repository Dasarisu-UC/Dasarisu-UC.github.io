      <h2>Labs Overview</h2>
      <h3>Lab 0 Overview</h3>
      <p>This Lab consists of two parts, under part 1, I have requested and deployed the ubuntu virtual machine and installed some required softwares to setup the lab, such as net-tools, sublime text, git, pandoc, apache 2, google chrome, wireshark. Under part 2, I am going to clone the course repository to my local machine and generate an ssh keygen so that I can clone my private respository to my local machine without using any user credentials and do the git actions.</p><br>
      <h3>Lab 1 Overview</h3>
      <p>In this lab there are two parts, in part one I am familiarized with the Wireshark tool and the HTTP protocol to understand the packet information that is captured, as well as I have understood the protocol using the telnet and Wireshark. In Part 2, I have written a .c file and converted it into the common gateway interface file to run it in the web browser using the apache2 service. Also, I have written a homework html file index.cgi file and executed the same. As for the task two and three I have demonstrated the helloworld.php and echo.php, as well as I have examined those request and responses in the Wireshark and curl and observed the difference between the response and the request.</p><br>
      <h3>Lab 2 Overview</h3>
      <p>In this lab there are two tasks with subtasks included. In task 1, there are two sub tasks, where in the part a, I have learned and executed HTML file with some basic tags in it and a image of mine and a form in it. Coming to part b, I have learned how to implement simple javascript in the html document, where I have executed the javascript code in HTML tags to display current date/time and also to log when a key is pressed on the keyboard in the browser console. Also, I have used inline script tag to display a digital clock in the HTML file. Including with that I have also executed the script code in the HTML document to show/hide my email when clicked. Atlast I have displayed analog clock using external javascript code in the HTML file. As per the Task 2, there are four parts, part a refers to the AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) where I have written the code for user input when the button is clicked, an AJAX GET request to the echo.php web application which is already executed in the previous lab 1 and listen to the HTTP response and display the same. Part b referes to the CSS, where I have added the one the stylesheet which is referred in the class, I have choosen the stylesheet 1 and applied to the html document with specific div tags applied. In the part c, it refers to the jQuery, here there are two sub parts, sub part 1 refers to the Ajax GET request to echo.php web application and displays the respone content. Coming to the second sub part, its about the POST request to the echo.php web application and displays the response content. In the Part 4, there are again two sub sections, in the sub-section one its about sending a JS code using jQuery Ajax to send a request and handled the response to display a random joke from the above API when the page is loaded and inspected the request and responses accordingly in the browsers network tab. In the second sub section, its about the user input from the interface and examine the request and responses accordingly. </p><br>
      <h3>Hackathon 1 Overview</h3>
      <p>There were two smaller components to this hackathon.Task 1 deals with attacks carried out in various ways.I was aware of how websites are attacked via cross-scripting.Input validations and encoding techniques are the focus of Task 2.I comprehended the process of data validation both prior to and following the reply.</p><br>
      <h3>Individual Project 1 Overview</h3>
      <p>In this Individual project assignment, there are three requirements, general requirements, technical and non- technical requirements. under general requirements, I have used a bootstrap personal portfolio theme which is available for free in the internet which is developed by the developer Xiaoying Riley. In the general requirements, I have implemented my headshot, basic info about me in the portfolio, contact information, background and education, experiences and skills. Not only but also the HTML page is integrated in the portfolio which introduces Web Application Programming and Hacking course and related hands-on projects. Under Non-technical requirements, I have used the open source CSS template which is bootstrap, also I have included the page tracker in my website which counts the page views. under technical requirements, I have used Jquery to implement digital clock, analog clock, show/hide my email. For one more functionality, I have used angular JS framework for generating a functionality which is a USD to INR converter. Later, I have implmeneted joke API which updates every 60-seconds using Jquery. Next I have implemented random image generator from picsum API which generates random images every 3.5 seconds. Finally, I have implemented the JS cookies to remember the client which displays the welcome message and also it displays the welcome back message when the same user get backs to portfolio with date and time.</p>
